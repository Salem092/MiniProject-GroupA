    <p>The Hundred Years' War was a long struggle between England and France over succession to the French throne. It lasted from 1337 to 1453, so it might more accurately be called the "116 Years' War." The war starts off with several 
        stunning successes on Britain's part, and the English forces dominate France for decades.</p>
